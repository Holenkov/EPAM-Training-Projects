2The City is the oldest part of London, its financial and business centre. The heart of the City 
is the Stock Exchange. Westminster is the most important part of the capital. It's the 
administrative centre. The Houses of Parliament, the seat of the British Government, are there. 
It's a very beautiful building with two towers, and a very big clock called Big Ben. Big Ben is 
really the bell which strikes every quarter of an hour. Opposite the Houses of Parliament is 
Westminster Abbey. It's a very beautiful church built over 900 years ago... The tombs of many great 
statesmen, scientists and writers are there.
